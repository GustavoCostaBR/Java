This is the Quick-Find-Union Algorithm with path compression applied to a Monte Carlo simulation previewing the percolation of a system. It must be compiled with the library algs4 provided.

In windows system it can be compiled by using:
javac -cp ".\algs4.jar;." .\PercolationStats.java

To run use:
java -cp ".\algs4.jar;." PercolationStats 20 200

The first argument is the dimension of the grid and the second one the number of tries to be computed.


In unix like system it can be compiled using:
javac -cp ./algs4.jar:. PercolationStats.java

To run use:
java -cp ./algs4.jar:. PercolationStats
